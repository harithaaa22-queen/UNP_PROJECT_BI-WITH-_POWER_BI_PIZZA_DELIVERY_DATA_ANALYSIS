# UNP_PROJECT_BI-WITH-_POWER_BI_PIZZA_DELIVERY_DATA_ANALYSIS

I completed POWER bi project in collaboration with UNP eductaion on PIZZA DELIVERY DATA ANALYSIS
The project examines key factors such as total orders, delivery time, delay percentage, traffic impact, and payment methods.
The dataset includes order details like location, pizza size, pizza type, delivery duration, traffic level, and payment mode.
Using Power BI, we created calculated columns and DAX measures to compute KPIs such as Total Orders, Average Delivery Time, Delay %, and Delivery Speed categories.
The dashboard is divided into Executive Overview, Order Analysis, Delivery Performance, Delay Analysis, and Payment Analysis pages.
The analysis identified peak order hours, high-traffic delay zones, popular pizza types, and dominant digital payment usage.
Based on insights, the project provides business recommendations to improve delivery efficiency, reduce delays, and enhance customer satisfaction.
